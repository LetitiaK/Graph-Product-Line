# Graph Product Line
This Python library supports different configurations of data structures and algorithms for representing and computing on graphs.

Features and Variabilities: Undirected Graphs, Digraphs, Weighted Graphs, Edge List and Neighbor List Representations, Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm), Single-Source Shortest Path (Dijkstra’s algorithm)


This project was implemented for the Master’s course “Dynamic Programming Techniques”.
